# PyCitySchools Pandas Challenge Summary #
# Overview #
In this project, I assumed the role of Chief Data Scientist for a city's school district, leveraging Python's Pandas library to analyze district-wide standardized test results. My goal was to aggregate data from various sources to identify key trends in school performance, aiding strategic decisions for future school budgets and priorities.

# Key Accomplishments #
## District Summary Analysis: ##
- Calculated and presented a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame, including total schools, students, budget, average scores, and passing percentages.
## School Summary Analysis ##
- Compiled a comprehensive DataFrame summarizing essential metrics for each school, such as school type, total students, budget, per student budget, average scores, and passing rates.
## Performance Evaluation ##
- Identified highest- and lowest-performing schools based on overall passing rates, showcasing the top 5 and bottom 5 schools in separate DataFrames.
- Analyzed average math and reading scores by grade level for each school.
## Advanced Data Analysis ##
- Categorized schools based on spending per student, and analyzed their performance in relation to budget allocations.
- Examined school performance based on school size and type, creating distinct DataFrames for each category.
## Reporting and Documentation ##
- Exported all analysis results into structured DataFrames and text files for easy access and presentation.
- Authored a written report summarizing the analysis and highlighting at least two observable trends from the data.
## Technical Proficiency ##
- Demonstrated advanced data manipulation skills using Python and Pandas.
- Efficiently handled large datasets, performing complex aggregations, and calculations.
- Maintained clean, well-commented code throughout the project.
## Project Management ##
- Created and managed a dedicated GitHub repository ('pandas-challenge') for the project, including folders for each Python assignment (PyCitySchools), resources, and analyses.
- Ensured regular commits and clear documentation in the repository for easy tracking and reproducibility of the analysis.
